# Todo List

This list was generated by a conversation with ChatGPT before being tweaked & updated

## 7/21 Update

I would consider the "core" functionality to be complete. **There are various bugfixes, code smells, and general improvements that are planned but need to be better documented**. This document will likely be removed or replaced in the near future with a new list of planned functionality; perhaps a roadmap towards v1.0!

## Initialization
- [X] Define the required libraries and modules
  - **selenium** for signing in/automating browsing
  - **sqlite3** for managing the database
  - **re** for helping to parse the scraped data
  - *sleep* from **time** for delays
  - **requests** for core download functionality
  - *ZipFile* from **zipfile** for extracting zip files
  - **os** for path joining
  - **argparse** for argument parsing
  - **urllib.parse** for converting "percent codes" to their corresponding characters
- [X] Set up the directory structure for your application
  - __bcdl.py__ the script
  - __bcdl.db__ the default album database
  - __user_pass__ file to read user/pass from for debug
  - __debug_log__ debug information is printed to it
  - __./downloads/__ where the zip files end up
  - __README.md__ simple readme
  - __TODO.md__ this file
- [X] Initialize the database where you will store the purchased music information
  - __create_db()__ function does this

## Login
- [X] Implement the functionality to sign into Bandcamp
- [X] Store the user's login credentials in a secure way
  - Calling this done for now, since the user can now manually sign into the selenium browser on their own

## Scrape Information
- [X] Scrape the information about the purchased music from the user's Bandcamp account
  - Currently scrapes *Artist*, *Album*, *Download Page*, *Popularity*, a link to the *bandcamp page*, and whether or not the album is listed as *Private*
  - [X] Explore what other information can be scraped
    - The "core" scraping functionalities are complete
- [X] Store this information in the database
  - __add_to_db(...)__ and __dl_page_in_db(download_page)__ both implemented

## Search Functionality
- [X] Print the entire database and allow the user to select which albums to download
- [X] Implement the core search functionality
  - [X] Explore/plan additional search options
    - Marking as complete; anything in addition to what is done is all "extra"
    - [X] Would like an option to return all releases containing non-english characters
- [X] Return the search results to the user via pacman-like interface

## Download & Unzip Functionality
- [X] Implement the functionality to download one or several albums
  - [X] ...in the desired format
- [X] Unzip into a directory
  - [X] Allow the user to supply a location (ie: /mnt/Music/)

## CLI
- [X] Begin implementing CLI arguments
- [X] Implement all of the planned CLI arguments
  - Marking as complete; anything in addition to what is done is all "extra"
